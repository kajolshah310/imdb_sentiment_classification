# IMDB Sentiment Classification

## Description
This repository focuses on sentiment classification of IMDB movie reviews. The objective is to develop a model that can accurately classify the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews.

Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding public opinion and sentiment towards various products, services, or in this case, movies. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning algorithms, we can analyze the text of movie reviews and predict whether the sentiment expressed is positive or negative.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset. It consists of a large number of movie reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels. The dataset is widely used in sentiment analysis tasks and provides a diverse range of reviews, making it suitable for training and evaluating sentiment classification models.

## Approach
The project involves the following steps:
1. Data preprocessing, including text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.
2. Implementation of deep learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, logistic regression, or deep learning models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and LSTM for sentiment classification.
3. Model training and evaluation using appropriate performance metrics to assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

## Usage
1) Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/kajolshah310/imdb_sentiment_classification.git
```
2) Open the project in your preferred IDE or notebook environment.

3) Install the required packages and dependencies mentioned in the project files, if necessary.

4) Execute the code and follow along with the implementation of the sentiment classification model.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different algorithms or models, or explore additional techniques to improve the accuracy of the sentiment predictions.
